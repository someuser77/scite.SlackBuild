SciTE is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate
Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities
for building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple
configurations.

There is an example configuration file (config/SciTEUser.properties) 
provided with the tarball.  If you'd like to use it (at your own risk), 
see the different options at http://www.scintilla.org/SciTEDoc.html, 
rename it to .SciTEUser.properties, and place it in your user's homedir.
